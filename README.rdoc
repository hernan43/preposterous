= preposterous 

I'm hoping that I will stick to this and it will become a very functional Ruby based API for the Posterous(http://posterous.com) service.

Since I've never really done anything like this, I am going to use John Nunemaker's(http://github.com/jnunemaker) Twitter gem(http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter) design as an influence.
